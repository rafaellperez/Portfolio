# Portfolio
This portfolio shows eight projects I have completed. Five projects refer to data visualization projects.

Three of these projects are published in peer-reviewed journals in economics.
The projects section in this portfolio provides a general description of each project.
For each project, I include the following items:
1. A description of the project,
2. An overview of the methodology that I used, and
3. A brief summary of the findings or results.

I include these items in the Project section. I also included the cleaned dataset for the energy projects. I would be more than happy to share the other datasets.
