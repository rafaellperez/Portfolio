# Portfolio
This portfolio shows three projects I have completed. Two of these projects are published in peer-reviewed journals and the other is under review.
The projects section in this portfolio provides a general description of each project.
For each project, I include the following items:
1. A description of the project,
2. An overview of the methodology that I used, and
3. A brief summary of the findings or results.
I include these items in the Project section. I also included the cleaned dataset for the energy project. I would be more than happy to share the two other datasets.
I included a quick graph of the potential impact of COVID-19 in El Paso County in employment.
